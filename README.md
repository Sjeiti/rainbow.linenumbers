# Rainbow.linenumbers

A plugin for [Rainbow](http://rainbowco.de) to show linenumbers.

## Instructions

Just include Rainbow.linenumbers.js alongside Rainbow.js

The text color of the numbers is that of the &lt;pre&gt; tag.
The line color is that of the border-color of the &lt;pre&gt; tag.
To start at a specific line number include the attribute data-line="123" in your &lt;code&gt; tag.

Make sure the word-wrap of your &lt;code&gt; tag is set to normal (this plugin is not build for wrapping single lines).
