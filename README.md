# Rainbow.linenumbers

A plugin for [Rainbow](http://rainbowco.de) to show linenumbers.

## Instructions

Just include Rainbow.linenumbers.js alongside Rainbow.js

The text color of the numbers is that of the <pre> tag.
The line color is that of the border-color of the <pre> tag.
To start at a specific line number include the attribute data-line="123" in your <code> tag.

Make sure the word-wrap of your <code> tag is set to normal (this plugin is not build for wrapping single lines).
